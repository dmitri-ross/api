# CompanyDAO.org API Documentation

The base URL to connect to the API is `https://api.companydao.org`.

## Authentication
All API requests require authentication. You need to pass your API key in the Authorization header as a Bearer token. 

```
Authorization: Bearer <Your API Key>
```

## Networks
CompanyDAO.org operates on two blockchain networks - Ethereum (ETH) and Polygon (Matic).

## Blockchain Transactions
Certain POST requests will produce blockchain transactions, which are relayed through our system. The relayer's balance must have enough funds to send transactions. To check the relayer's information, use the `getRelayerInfo` endpoint.

```
GET /relayer
```
Response:
```json
[
  {
    "address": "<Relayer Address on Chain 1>",
    "balance": "<Relayer Balance on Chain 1>",
    "chainId": "<Chain ID 1>"
  },
  {
    "address": "<Relayer Address on Chain 2>",
    "balance": "<Relayer Balance on Chain 2>",
    "chainId": "<Chain ID 2>"
  }
]
```

For each POST request that produces a transaction, the response will include the transaction hash (`tx_hash`), the chain ID (`chainId`), and a URL to view the transaction on Etherscan (for Ethereum transactions) or Polygonscan (for Polygon transactions).

Response example:
```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "tx_hash": "<Transaction Hash>",
  "chainId": "<Chain ID>",
  "explorerURL": "<URL to Etherscan/Polygonscan>"
}
```
